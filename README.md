### Hello world 👋 

---

Hi, I'm Kiara. I'm a classical musician, educator, and web developer based in Canada.

I'm an undergraduate BMus student majoring in musicology and sound studies with a minor in psychology, focusing on mental health and well-being. I'm interested in using technology to help make music performance and recording spaces more accessible for neurodivergent artists.
