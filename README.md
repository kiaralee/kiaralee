### Hello world 👋

Hi, I'm Kiara. I'm a classical musician, educator, and web developer based in Vancouver, BC.

I have an undergraduate degree in musicology & sound studies and am currently a graduate student in music performance. I'm interested in using technology to help make music performance and recording spaces more accessible for neurodivergent artists.
